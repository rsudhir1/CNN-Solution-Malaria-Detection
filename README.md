# CNN-Solution-Malaria-Detection

In this project, I explore, manipulate and visualise an image set of malaria infected and uninfected cells. I use Gaussian image manipulation, mean images, HSV representation, and data augmentation to test whether distinctive features become more visible. Then I create multiple CNN models with various parameters to test performance on the dataset. The measured success metrics were accuracy and minimal false negatives.

The final proposed model attained an accuracy of 98.3% with only 12 instances of false negatives from a test dataset of 2600 images.

This project contains a Jupyter notebook, an HTML version, and a PowerPoint presentation that presents my findings. Within the notebook is a report that goes into further detail about the motivations and techniques used in this project.
